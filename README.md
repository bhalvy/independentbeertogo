# Independent Beer to Go
### STAY HOME, DRINK LOCAL, AND SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT BREWERY. 
[https://independentbeertogo.com](https://independentbeertogo.com) 

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit a number of industries hard including our local craft brewers. Luckily, many have kept their doors open for the sale of beer to-go. The idea of this site it to provide a listing of breweries, starting with LA County, that are currently offering you the chance to pickup a growler, crowler, bottle, can, or keg of fresh beer.
